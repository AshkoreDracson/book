# Introduction
Welcome (potential) lucid dreamer! If you got linked this you might have been
asked to add a guide to this book. See the "Contributing" section below on how
to do that.

_This book is a heavy work in progress. Feel free to add new guides haphazardly
if you feel the book needs the subject and doesn't have it yet, other
contributors will clean them up and organize them._

## What you will find in this book
Structured guides on various lucid dreaming techniques. How to lucid dream and
how to do various things while lucid dreaming.

## What you will _not_ find in this book
Paranormal guides or articles.

## Contributing
Contributions are done using "Pull Requests", see the [GitHub documentation on pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
on how to contribute.
If you feel this is too complex or too much work for you to do right now, just
ask a contributor (perhaps the person who asked you to contribute to this book)
to add it for you.

This book is created using [mdBook](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook), and is
written in the "Markdown" format.
If you're familiar with Reddit's comment and post formatting you'll feel right
at home.

You can use the GitHub site for adding and editing files, it has a pretty good
markdown preview. You can also use your own Git client to download the files and
edit them on your own computer. (For example, GitKraken, SourceTree, or GitHub
for Windows)
